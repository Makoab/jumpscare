# Jumpscare Prank Website

This project allows you to create a **jumpscare** website to prank your friends. By hosting this site and sharing the link, you can surprise unsuspecting visitors with a sudden scare.

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: Easily host the website on any platform that supports static files.
- **Customizable Content**: Modify the scare image and sound to your preference.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal files for quick loading and deployment.

## How It Works

1. **Landing Page**: The `index.html` file presents a seemingly innocent webpage to lure the visitor.
2. **Trigger**: After a set time or specific user interaction, the scare is triggered.
3. **Jumpscare**: A sudden image (`scare.jpg`) accompanied by a loud sound (`scream2.mp3`) is displayed to startle the user.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Makoab/jumpscare.git
   ```
2. **Host the Files**: Upload the contents to a web hosting service or use a local server for testing.
3. **Share the Link**: Distribute the hosted link to your friends to prank them.

## Customization

- **Change the Scare Image**: Replace `scare.jpg` with your desired image. Ensure the new image has the same filename or update the reference in `index.html`.
- **Modify the Sound**: Replace `scream2.mp3` with your preferred sound effect. Update the filename in `index.html` if changed.
- **Adjust Timing**: Edit the JavaScript in `index.html` to change when the jumpscare is triggered.

## Disclaimer

**Warning**: This project is intended for harmless pranks among friends. Ensure that the person you're pranking doesn't have health conditions that could be adversely affected by sudden scares. Use responsibly.
